# TrainEscape
Train escape is a small project I made to explore some of the features of Unreal Engine 5

In this game the player must figure out the combination to a locked crate that houses a key card so that they can make their escape.

Some of the many features this game includes:  
Importing/customizing free community assets  
Blueprint Widget for basic UI  
Blueprints for UI and door controls   
Sound integration  
First person Actor Customization  

IDE: Visual Studio 2022 express edition  
Tool Kit: HoloToolkit V2017.2
